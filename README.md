# Day 3 - API Integration Report - [clothing]

## Overview
This document outlines the process of API integration, schema adjustments, and data migration for [Your Marketplace Name]. It includes key steps, tools used, and best practices followed during implementation.

---

## API Integration Process
- Integrated the API by setting up secure endpoints.
- Configured authentication using API keys stored in `.env` files.
- Modularized the code for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Adjustments Made to Schemas
- Updated schemas to include new fields required by the API data.
- Ensured proper data validation for all fields using Sanity CMS tools.
- Adjusted constraints to match the API response format.

## Migration Steps and Tools Used
1. **Preparation**:
   - Analyzed the API structure and mapped it to the schema.
   - Created a backup of the existing data.
2. **Migration Process**:
   - Used custom scripts to pull data from the API and insert it into Sanity CMS.
   - Validated data types and constraints during migration.
3. **Tools**:
   - **Node.js**: For scripting and API integration.
   - **Postman**: For API testing and debugging.
   - **Sanity Client**: For interacting with Sanity CMS.

## Screenshots
1. **API Calls**
   - Include screenshots of successful API calls using Postman.
2. **Frontend Data**
   - Show data being successfully displayed on the frontend interface.
3. **Sanity CMS Fields**
   - Display populated fields in Sanity CMS after migration.

## Code Snippets
### API Integration
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';
import axios from 'axios';

const sanityClient = createClient({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  dataset: 'your-dataset',
  apiVersion: '2023-01-01',
  useCdn: false,
});

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data', {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` },
    });

    await sanityClient.createOrReplace({
      _id: 'unique-id',
      _type: 'your-schema-type',
      ...response.data,
    });
    console.log('Data migrated successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during API integration:', error);
  }
};

fetchData();
```

### Migration Script
```javascript
const migrateData = async () => {
  const data = await fetchFromAPI();

  data.forEach(async (item) => {
    try {
      await sanityClient.create({
        _type: 'your-schema-type',
        title: item.title,
        description: item.description,
        ...item,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Migration Error:', error);
    }
  });
};

migrateData();
```

## Best Practices Followed
1. **Secure Data Handling**:
   - API keys stored securely in `.env` files.
2. **Clean Coding Practices**:
   - Used descriptive variable names.
   - Modularized functions for better readability.
   - Added comments for complex logic.
3. **Data Validation**:
   - Ensured all migrated data adhered to schema constraints.
   - Logged discrepancies for further investigation.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Maintained a changelog for schema adjustments.
   - Included screenshots and detailed testing notes.
5. **Version Control**:
   - Used Git for tracking changes.
   - Committed frequently with meaningful messages.
6. **Thorough Testing**:
   - Validated endpoints with Postman.
   - Handled edge cases like empty responses and invalid data.
7. **Peer Review**:
   - Shared code and documentation for feedback and applied suggestions.
